  Not allowing third-party libraries in your software package has many advantages:
  <UL>
    <LI>You are not worried (your reputation is not tarnished) about other peopleâ€™s bugs which are out of your control</LI>
    <LI>Releasing, deploying, and versioning become simpler to <I>a lot simpler</I></LI>
    <LI>Debugging becomes simpler to <I>a lot simpler</I></LI>
    <LI>Backward compatibility comes under your control</LI>
    <LI>You have a free hand to revise your design and code</LI>
  </UL>

  It also has some disadvantages:
  <UL>
    <LI>There might be functionalities that are hard/time-consuming to implement that are already there</LI>
	<LI>If you find a battle-tested library, the debugging is already done for you</LI>
	<LI>There might be industry-wide standards/trends that you want to follow by using a reputed library</LI>
  </UL>
